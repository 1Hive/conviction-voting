The Conviction Voting app is used to allocate funds on proposals based on the
conviction an entire organization has on them.

Conviction can be signaled by staking organization tokens on proposals, and it
is not fully activated until a certain period of time has passed.

## Features
- Apply for funding from an organization's treasury.
- Browse a list of proposals and see the conviction they have earned over the
time and the prediction on its accumulation or dissipation.
- Stake your tokens on one proposal to make the conviction on it grow. If the
conviction surpasses a certain threshold, the proposal will be able to be
executed.
